Objective
Develop a full-stack AI system that detects and visualizes welding defects from radiographic (X-ray) images. The system should include a Python-based backend that uses a trained object detection model, and a React frontend that allows users to upload images and view detection results.

Backend Overview (Python with YOLOv8)
Features
Image Upload Endpoint
Create an API endpoint that receives X-ray images via HTTP POST requests.

Defect Detection
Use a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to identify defects such as cracks, porosity, slag inclusions, and others. Extract relevant details like bounding boxes, class labels, confidence scores, and object sizes.

Image Analysis
Optionally include additional analysis such as scene classification or dominant color extraction.

Response Format
Return the detection results in a structured JSON format, including information about the image, defects, and metadata.

API Accessibility
Ensure the API can be accessed by the frontend (enable CORS) and is capable of handling image inputs reliably.

Tools and Technologies
Python

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Flask or FastAPI

OpenCV

PIL (Pillow)

scikit-learn (optional)

flask-cors or equivalent

Frontend Overview (React)
Features
Image Upload
Allow users to upload radiographic images through a simple interface. Support preview of the image before submission and basic validation of file type and size.

API Integration
Send the uploaded image to the backend API and handle the response. Display status updates such as loading, success, or error messages.

Visualization of Results
Display the uploaded image along with bounding boxes and labels indicating detected defects. Include overlays that show defect types and confidence scores.

Analysis Panel
Show a side panel or section summarizing the detection results, such as number of detected objects, classes of defects, and overall insights.

Optional 3D Visualization
Add an optional 3D visualization feature to simulate weld geometry and highlight defect zones using Three.js or React Three Fiber.

Responsive Design
Ensure the interface works well across devices with a clean and modern UI using a utility-first CSS framework.

Tools and Technologies
React

Axios or Fetch API

Tailwind CSS or ShadCN UI

React Konva or HTML Canvas for 2D overlays

React Three Fiber or Three.js (optional for 3D)

Zustand or React Context (optional for state management)

Workflow Summary
The user uploads an X-ray image through the frontend.

The frontend sends the image to the backend via an API call.

The backend processes the image using the YOLOv8 model and returns detection results in JSON format.

The frontend visualizes the results with bounding boxes and detailed information about detected defects.

Optionally, the frontend provides a 3D view of defect locations.

Outcome
This project demonstrates how to integrate computer vision and deep learning with modern web technologies to build an intelligent non-destructive testing tool. The system is capable of automating weld inspection and presenting interpretable results to end-users through an interactive web interface.
